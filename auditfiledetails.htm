<p class="MsoNormal">The Audit file started life as a simple log of PsaConnect 
activity that was kept for 7 days. With the arrival of PSA3 and auto-sync users 
it became essential to track who was updating which records and when.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The solution was the creation in PSA of the .adt audit file. 
PsaConnect now writes its log to the same file as it is updating the same 
database and records.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the SQL database is called Live then the audit files will 
have the format Live_&lt;company&gt;_&lt;plantcode&gt;_yymmdd.adt where yymmdd 
is the current date. IA new file is created each day. Old files are retained for 
a user definable number of days up to 9999. We recommend around 30 days – this 
gives time to investigate later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All new records are written to the end of the file – 
therefore this is a chronological log – even if the reported times do not match 
– this is due to the update time being reported from the internal clock of each 
updating PC. Therefore synchronizing all PCs with an internet clock can reduce 
some confusion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are several types of record in the file. All fields in 
each record are divided by colon characters<br />All the records start with the 
same 3 fields <br />2017_03_21 14_29_11   - this is date and 
time<br />312                         
- the version of the program (PSA or 
PsaConnect<br />XX                           
- record type</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are 10 main types<br />QQ – queuing control <br />TD – 
Trickle Down – see also XX below<br />PM – Program Message<br />TP – transfers to 
Radius by PsaConnect<br />TS – transfers to SFDC by PsaConnect<br />FP – transfers 
from Radius to PSA<br />FS – transfers from SFDC to PSA<br />CN – PsaConnect 
synchronizing data form local to SQL db<br />IN – information records<br />ER – 
error lines</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are also lines containing extra detail indicated by XX= 
see TD below for further detail</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>QQ - Queuing Control</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A typical record looks like</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">J:,|,|,|,|,|,|,|,48,|0:True:TM1:48:4:0:Bill B:628900227"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">J – is the record type – J=Join queue and test for 
permission, T= Test queue for permission, P=processing, D=Delete queue 
entry<br />At logon each user is allocated a number – in this case 48 that is used 
until they log off.<br />,|,|,|,|,|,|,|,48,|0 are the queue details divided into 9 
sections – the first 4 are populated by users waiting for access in 4 separate 
categories – the second 4 are populated by users connected to the SQL db in 4 
categories – the last is a number incremented by waiting users and reset to zero 
by the updating user – if it reaches a set value waiting users will assume the 
updating user is no longer processing and reset the queue<br />True – value 
returned – J and T can both return True – OK to proceed with update – P and D 
always return False<br />TM1 – tells us where it was called from<br />48 – the users 
allocated number<br />4 – the queuing category – 1= PSA What-If with updates, 2 = 
PsaConnect, 3 = AutoSync users with updates, 4 = all PSA users just wanting to 
read latest data<br />0 – an estimate of the number of users waiting<br />Bill B – 
the user name<br />628900227 – the version being held by this user</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sync events usually consist of a sequence of J, P and D 
lines<br />On the D line there are a final 4 numbers – the number of reads, adds, 
changes and deletes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>TD – Trickle Down</b> <br />Format of these records 
is<br />Tammy:Job:105538.1.1150.68257:C:XX=P:2034:7050:9065571:False:C:False:True_:9064591:WI"<br />Tammy 
– user name<br />Job – the table being updated<br />105538.1.1150.68257 – the 
jobcode, component, task number and internal record number of the record being 
updated – the primary key is always given here<br />C – update type – A = Add, C = 
Change, D = Delete<br />XX=P:2034:7050:9065571:False:C:False:True_:9064591 – 
updates to the job (task) table may have an addition section headed XX= followed 
by old values for status,work center, speed, start time and 4 other fields – 
followed by new values for these fields if changed – this is typical in that 
only the start time has changed<br />WI – Indicating a What-If user – can also be 
AS - Autosync<br />In this case the start time has been changed from 9065571 to 
9064591</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>PM – Program 
Message</b><br />PM:628900237:628900236:25:Start Update Materials  
17248"<br />Mostly from PsaConnect – start or end of various sections enabling 
times to be checked<br />Almost all end with a number – 17248 in this case – that 
is the number of seconds since last user action on keyboard<br /><br /><b>TP – 
transfers to Radius by 
PsaConnect</b><br />TP:628900269:628900268:25:job:106118.1.1250:C"<br />long numbers 
are version being written and version held<br />job – table from which data is 
transferred – start time, status etc<br />106118.1.1250 – primary key of record 
being transferred<br />C – change<br /><br /><b>TS – transfers to SFDC by 
PsaConnect<br /></b>TS:628900269:628900268:25:job:106863.1.1150.9064287.9064287.2034.7163:A"<br />long 
numbers are version being written and version held<br />job – table from which 
data is transferred – start time, status etc<br />6863.1.1150.9064287 – primary 
key and internal record number of record being transferred<br />2034 – work centre 
<br />A – add – first write of this record – can also be C - change<br /><br /><b>FP – 
transfers from Radius to 
PSA</b><br />FP:628900270:628900269:25:ordheader:107162.U.4:A"<br />long numbers are 
version being written and version held<br />ordheader – table being imported 
to<br />107162 – job code – primary key<br />U – status Unplanned – can also be P – 
Planned<br />4 – allocated colour<br />there may also be ‘last user code’ from 
Radius here<br />A – Add – can also be C - Change</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br /><b>FS – transfers from SFDC to 
PSA</b><br />FS:628900237:628900236:25:job:106300.1.1150:0:C"<br />long numbers are 
version being written and version held<br />job:106300.1.1150 – table and primary 
key being imported<br />0 – task is complete or held – 1 – task is still 
running</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>SH – Store Hash<br /></b>SH:628900270:628900269:25:Store 
Hash 3:106802|1|1150:3505971589"<br />these records store details of records that 
will be updated at a later time<br />Details include the record locator and hash 
total so that changes between the current time and the update being applied are 
detected</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>AU – Apply Updates</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">AU:628900270:628900269:25:Apply Update 
3:105996|1|1250:3505972470"<br />Matches the SH lines – hash total are checked 
before updating.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br /><b>CN – PsaConnect synchronizing data from local to SQL 
db</b><br />CN:628900237:628900236:Con8_224:Job:105295.1.1150.67092:C::STRTIME:9057032:9057037<br />This 
is basically the same as Trickle Down performed by PSA users – it shows the 
table, primary key, update type (A, C, D) – for table job (task) changes in 
start time and status are logged</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>IN – information 
records</b><br />IN:628900237:628900236:25:Order complete in Radius 106012 LU=KF 
JS=20 PS=9 PC=True<br />Records unusual events such as merging and deletes in PSA 
– this case shows a job not being imported from Radius despite the extract flag 
being set – LU is the last user from Radius, JS is the job status (20=WIP), PS 
is the production status (4=planned, 9=complete in PSA, 99=early delete in PSA, 
PC is Production Complete flag in Radius<br /><br /><b>ER – error lines</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These are here to help us resolve issues – their position in 
the log is often critical</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">ER:Sue:AS:3704:Operation is not allowed….:Menu/Timer1 
0"<br />Sue – user name<br />AS – autosync – can also be WI<br />3704 – the error 
number – see section below<br />Operation is not allowed…. – the error 
message<br />These are almost always followed by a ‘LastSQL’ 
line<br />ER:LastSQL:select * from parameter with (updlock) where compnum = 100 
and plantcode = '10' and pname = 'QQQ'<br />This is likely to point directly to 
the cause of the error or a record containing bad data that leads to the 
error</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Following any error the adt file is a vital part </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Update Records</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For this reason sending the ADT file to Radius for analysis 
will probably result in a faster resolution of the problem.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For supervisor users of PSA there is a further useful Utility 
currently only available from the main menu screen called ‘View Audit Logs’. 
This opens a further screen where the logs for a single day or range of days may 
be viewed. There is a physical display limit of 350,000 lines. However a 
powerful filter option can be used by specifying an order number, user code or 
similar to concentrate on the area of interest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The whole selection of highlighted lines may be saved for 
sending to EFI.</p></div></body></html>
