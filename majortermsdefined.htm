<p class="MsoNormal">A definition of terms</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Order </b>– A production order to produce one or more 
items. Consists of one or more components and may be linked to a sales order</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Component </b>– Consists of one or more tasks that are the 
operations on the same part of the production route</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Task </b>– a single operation on a work centre – when 
linked to Radius II the output may consist of several different sheets or boards 
differing only due to plate changes</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Work Centre</b> – a machine – possibly with other linked 
machines that perform an operation that is part of the production route. Outwork 
may be treated as a work centre in most situations</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Display Code</b> – a user defined group of one or more 
work centres. Can be used to filter selections or display the desired work 
centres on the left of the planning board</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Unplanned</b> – an order is normally imported unplanned – 
that is it has not been put into the desired production sequence</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Planned</b> – An order that has been sequenced and is 
ready for scheduling</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Scheduled</b> – A planned order where each task has been 
given a start and end time depending on resource and capacity restraints</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Forward Schedule</b> – the scheduling process starts by 
scheduling the first task and proceeds with subsequent tasks in turn. Material 
and resource constraints may be considered together with possible overlaps or 
contingency times between tasks</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Backward Schedule</b> - the scheduling process starts by 
scheduling the last task just prior to delivery date and proceeds with prior 
tasks in turn. If the first task schedules prior to ‘now’ it is normal for the 
process to revert to forward scheduling</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Fix Point Schedule</b> – Once an order has been scheduled 
it is possible to select one task and then reschedule prior and/or following 
tasks around the point – usually used after a task has been moved to resolve 
overlaps</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Work Centre Prioritised Scheduling</b> – From Schedule 
Control where the list of orders has been filtered by a work centre or display 
code the scheduling process will start with the task on the filtered work centre 
or display code and then complete with a fixed point schedule from this task. 
This will result in the tasks on that work centre being in the same sequence as 
listed in schedule control</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Technical Attribute</b> – a field up to 20 characters in 
length imported from Radius by defining exactly which estimate field or item 
detail is the source. Depending on the item being produced this may be sheet 
size, web width, coating detail or any one of 1,500+ possible fields.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Resource</b> – a user defined field for something that be 
satisfied before a task can be started. Used for such concepts as Customer 
Approval, Plates Made, Board Ordered, Board Available etc</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Key Date</b> – similar to a resource – they are mutually 
exclusive at this time – where a significant customer or third party input is 
required usually some time removed from production. Used for sending samples to 
customers prior to approval, checking for data from customers, triggering events 
linked to the start or end of a task.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Housekeeping</b> – a daily process where old orders and 
non working period details are removed and the database is compacted to save 
space and keep processes fast and efficient. Includes some validity 
checks.</p></div></body></html>
