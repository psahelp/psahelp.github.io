<p class="MsoNormal">A new feature introduced at the end of 2008 it enables 
planning gains by running similar jobs together to calculated and evaluated in 
the plan. It should make the old ‘follow on’ feature and reduced make ready 
times on split or grouped tasks redundant.<br />Whenever any task is placed or 
moved on the planning board the make ready reduction is recalculated for that 
and any other affected tasks. The routine works by comparing one or more 
attributes of the current task with the one scheduled immediately before it. 
Matched inks, die numbers, sheet sizes etc can lead to a reduction being 
calculated.<br />Set Up<br />First establish one or more ‘rules’ on the right side 
of the screen<br /><img src="ImagesExt/image9_53.png" alt="" /><br />Give each rule a 
meaningful name, select one or more attributes to compare. <br />If more than one 
attribute is selected – typically inks – then the only valid comparison is ‘=’. 
This is because the number of ‘matches’ is counted. Note that the sequence of 
the attributes is not important – if one task has Red, Green and Yellow ink and 
the following task has Blue, Red and Green ink then this will count as 2 matches 
although the same attributes do not match at all.<br />For a single attribute you 
can use &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= and &lt;&gt; comparisons – in some cases 
increasing or decreasing size sequences lead to time savings.<br />Enter either a 
time saving value in minutes or percentage</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For the ‘Applies to’ drop down<br />"All Jobs" is the most 
common entry - it applies to all tasks and reduces make ready on the basis there 
is some common element with the prior task on this work centre - same die, same 
inks etc<br />"Not same job" only does the comparison with prior task on same work 
centre if it is from a different job - this is because the estimate already 
takes the common element into consideration<br />"Same Job" - requires that prior 
task is from same job only before applying reduction<br />"W/C this task" is 
interesting - you can create a technical attribute based on the dummy table - 
pv_prior_wc - and specify a process type - this will return the work centre name 
where the item was last produced (info from pv_jobcosts). There is often a lot 
of time to be saved if a toll is 'known' to a work centre - once set up the 
first time the work centre 'remembers' the settings so subsequent use on the 
same work centre takes only a couple of minutes to set rather than much longer - 
so this option reduces make ready based on the item having been run previously 
on this work centre and is completely independent of the prior task.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Having established some rules these can be applied at process 
type or individual work centre level – An entry for a work centre overrides any 
process type setting.<br />Checking the No Reduction option leaves the estimated 
value in place – other option are then not relevant.<br />Putting a number of 
minutes in the Start Value box will override the estimated value – this is 
optional<br />Putting a number of minutes in the Minimum Value box sets the 
minimum calculated value that will be used – this is optional. There is a fixed 
lower limit of zero minutes – negative values are not allowed<br />Rules – select 
one or more rules to be allied to this process type or work centre.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In operation it will start with the estimated make ready, 
this can be overridden by a start value. For each rule it calculates a time or 
percentage reduction. These are added together and first the total percentage 
reduction is applied followed by the time reduction. If the result is negative 
it is set to zero. If the result is below a defined minimum then the minimum is 
used. The reduction is then multiplied by the ‘cost rate’ applicable to the work 
centre. This is repeated for all affected tasks and the ‘after’ time and value 
compared with the ‘before’ values. Any change is reported.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Note that dragging a task from one work centre to another 
will change the estimated make ready time if they have different ‘default make 
ready’ times.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ‘Calc’ button will recalculate all scheduled tasks – use 
this if any rules or applicability of rules change.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is also a new report on the Reports menu that reports 
total time and cost savings.</p>
