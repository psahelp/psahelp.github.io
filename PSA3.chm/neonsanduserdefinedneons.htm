<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri',sans-serif"><img src="ImagesExt/image9_95.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the bottom right of the planning board are 9 neon lights. 
As the mouse moves over a task ticket these neons change colour to indicate 
various status conditions. From the left they indicate</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>TL – Tooling availability</b> – This works like the 
Resource neon – right clicking opens a popup where ‘All’, or one or more 
specific tool types may be checked </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>LT - Late/Contingency/On time</b> - If red the task is 
scheduled to start after the latest possible start time for the order to be 
completed by the delivery/promised date. If yellow it is scheduled within 
‘contingency hours’ of the latest possible time </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>RS – Resource status</b> – Shows white for no resources 
applicable, green for all resources available, yellow for pending where some 
resources are expected prior to the start time, red where some resources are not 
available or are scheduled before the expected available time and blue for 
resources that were expected before task start but the expected time has passed 
and the resources are now overdue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>FF – Firm Free</b> – Red for tasks that have been firmed 
or lie to the left of the dynamic firm line and green for all others</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>PR – Previous Task</b> – red where the previous task has 
not been started, yellow if it has and green if the previous task of the order 
is complete or there is no previous task.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>OV – Overlaps</b> – shows task as green if overlapping 
with the previous task of the order, yellow if overlapping with the following 
task of the order and red if overlapping with both the previous and following 
tasks of the order. For parallel style tasks they will only show as overlapping 
if the overlap exceeds the allowed amount.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>SF - Shop Floor status</b> – tasks show as yellow or blue 
for make ready active and make ready complete, as green or red for running in 
good or bad copy, as magenta if held and grey if complete. The information is 
source from SFDC feedback if available otherwise the manually entered task 
status is displayed. Non started tasks show white</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>CN - Constrained Tasks</b> – tasks will show as red if 
resource constrained scheduling has been used and the task start time has been 
moved due to resource or material constraints. All other tasks show green.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>LV - Live/Tentative Orders</b> – Live (Confirmed) orders 
display green, tentative (provisional) show red. It is also possible orders not 
to be marked as live or tentative – this displays yellow</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>HD - Held Tasks</b> – Red for tasks that have been held – 
these tasks are not transferred to SFDC</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clicking a neon colours the whole board according to the 
selected neon without need to replot and provides a legend for each colour.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Right clicking on the LT neon open a small menu where the 
late status can be switched between testing against delivery date or promised 
date. If no promised date is set the delivery date is used. It is recommended 
that the promised date option should be used whenever possible</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Right clicking on the RS neon opens a resource selection 
window where individual or groups of resources may be selected. Many users will 
be responsible for only one or two resources and they can select just those of 
interest. The first two entries in the list are always ‘All’ for the overall 
resource picture and ‘Material’ for materials attached to the task. The other 
entries refer to the user defined resources.</p></div></body></html>
