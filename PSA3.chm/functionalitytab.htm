<p class="MsoNormal">Program functional preferences can be set in this screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri',sans-serif"><img src="ImagesExt/image9_33.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Use extended notes format’ – leave unchecked – specific to a 
single user</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Task Description default to Order Description’ – If Checked, 
task descriptions will default to the Order Description when adding new tasks in 
the ‘Order Maintenance Screen, otherwise task descriptions will default to the 
work centre name.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Task Over Run at 0.05 Mins’ – If Checked, task remaining run 
time will set to 0 hours and 5 minutes if a quantity completed is greater than 
the planned quantity in the Planning Board Task Maintenance Screen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Request Promise Date reason’ - If Checked then a reason will 
be expected to be entered when a change is made to the Promised Date</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"> ‘</span>Warn all overlaps 
when using dragdrop’ – this previously only warned if an overlap was being 
created or increased – there was no warning when the overlap was decreasing. 
With this option set any overlap will generate a warning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘When using dragdrop always shunt right’ – with this option 
unset (the current default) dragging a task to the right on a work centre the 
tasks jumped over are shunted left to maintain a group of contiguous tasks. With 
the option set it will still shunt right leaving a gap where it has been dragged 
from</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> ‘Perform capability group test when dragging and 
dropping’ – normally checked – when a dragged task is dropped on a different 
work centre selecting this option turns on a check that the work centre is 
‘capable’ – without this option any work centre of the same process type will be 
deemed capable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Warn on change of capability group’  is there to handle 
situations where capability groups don’t fully cover the details. For example 
sheet fed presses all have a process type in Radius of P100. However we might 
set up 2 capability groups, one for large format and one for small format both 
with limitations based on numbers of colours and UV capability. This option is 
designed to pick up a task moved from one group to another or from one group to 
no group that would not break any other rules.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Import and display inventory and ship reqs from all plants 
for each item – by default only plant specific details are shown – this is used 
particularly where stock is stored at other plants</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Default start of manual task updates to end of previous 
completed task’ – normally unchecked – applies only to system being updated 
manually within PSA3</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘When changing resources use achieved date as last change of 
status – normally unchecked – the achieved date is for information only and 
indicates when the status changed to Y. Setting this option makes the achieved 
date report the last change of status instead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Do not allow change of Live /Tentative status – normally 
unchecked but this may change. Decide who is responsible for converting orders 
from Tentative to Live. If this lies in the Radius area then check this 
option.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Request confirmation when scheduling a group of orders – 
normally unchecked – does what it says – confirmation is always requested for a 
full schedule of all selected orders</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Allow change of number up in task maintenance’ – normally 
unchecked – this is a specialised function where business forms are being 
produced. By changing the roll width the number up can be changed dynamically – 
for most situations this is not possible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Utilisation for Auto-Sync users – auto-sync users do not have 
access to Schedule Control and therefore cannot see Utilisation details – this 
option gives them access to Utilisation from the Reports/Utilisation menu</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Offer to adjust or split tasks….’ – normally unchecked. 
However if PSA3 is being used to record run status and quantities then this 
option may be useful – especially if a limited number of cartons is glued for 
call off. Completing the current task and creating a split, non-started, task 
for the remainder is a sensible way to schedule.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Allow time sheet entry’ – this password protected option 
turns on SFDC Lite. Do not use without reference to Radius.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Link tasks by item code – where we have separate print and 
following tasks for each item this effectively creates separate jobs for each 
item</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Allow task and order grouping’ – normally unchecked - as 
discussed above this is work in progress and should normally only be used on an 
experimental basis</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Add multiple parts for business forms orders’ – normally 
unchecked but should be turned on if using business forms. This enables 
attributes to be defined for each part of a business form and the attributes to 
be seen by clicking the task on the planning board</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Add item technical attributes – with this selected up to 40 
attributes can be added at item level – can’t be displayed on Dynamic Work list 
or task card but can be shown under Order Maintenance and item pop up</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Prevent delete of orders imported from Radius’ – does just 
what it says so probably best to check this option to avoid mistakes. If it 
causes problems it can be changed, fix the problem and restore the flag.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Retain task description during merge process’ – applies to 
description only. All your important task details such as resources, notes, 
scheduled work centres etc are always retained during merges.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Display planning board task behind non working period’ – 
normally unchecked. The default is that tasks will stretch over non working 
periods. Some users believe this implies possible overtime working – it doesn’t. 
However checking this option will make stretched task appear to run behind non 
working periods. For clarity the text on the task still appears in front of the 
non working period.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Ask for confirmation of all shunt button operations’ – does 
just what it says – if you believe that confirmation of each shunt operation 
helps prevent mistakes then check it – don’t forget that each shunt operation 
can be ‘undone’.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Disable promised date entry’ – normally unchecked. This 
requires a policy decision over who controls the promise date. If the scheduler 
can confirm and set a ‘promise’ date with a customer then leave it unchecked. If 
policy determines that a customer rep or equivalent must liaise with the 
customer and a replacement order with changed delivery date be raised then it is 
correct to check this option.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Enable DigiID spotlight function’ – normally unchecked as 
this is specific to a single customer. Checking it in error won’t help or hinder 
processing as the operative data will be missing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Use alternate option to split tasks with items – reverts to 
the old split method allowing split by quantity only – no printchange 
splitting</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Show non-working period comments on card – makes visible 
comments that can be added to individual non working periods</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remove replacement orders when original is deleted – usually 
only arise as replaces are imported at the same time original is completed</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Display long task duration as hh:mm only – the default shows 
dd:hh:mm</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Confirm task completion requests – normally unchecked</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Linked order processing – normally unchecked – In most cases 
of linked orders the link is to an order in another plant. This can take several 
minutes before both end of the link are fully updated. Where the link is between 
printing and finishing orders in the same plant turning this option on will 
ensure that both ends of the link are updated between every PSA3 update.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Convert finishing route to separate components’ – normally 
unchecked – applies to Radius II only and commercial jobs only where the 
finishing route contains many steps and the structure supplied from Radius 
contains a very long finishing component route. By breaking this into separate 
components at task level a better structure can be defined. This will be 
retained during a merge process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Use Key Date processing’ – normally unchecked – turns on the 
Key Dates routines that replace resources – see earlier section before 
committing to this option.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">‘Remove register from schedule control’ – normally checked - 
the register was an original PSA feature retained for backward compatibility. 
Other than for bulk planning of many orders at take on it is not required and it 
is recommended that all new users check this option and ignore its 
existence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No task access for Inquiry only users – does what it says</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Never reject updates – there was a period when many updates 
were being rejected due to changes from other users – this allowed the updates 
to proceed. Subsequent changes make this unnecessary – recommend unchecked</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Do not calculate remaining time for non aligned tasks – 
customer specific – we always recommend that data from SFDC is aligned so this 
is not relevant</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reset resources to default on merge or replace – normally 
resource changes are retained during merge – this changes that behaviour and 
resets them allowing for the resource checks to be 
repeated</p></div></body></html>
