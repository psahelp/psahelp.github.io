occur in the conversation with the Data Source through the SQL_ERROR variable 
from the Eagle INI file.  <br />The value of this variable is the combination 
of two different error codes, separated by the Separator character: the ODBC 
error code, whose values are listed below, and the Native error code. Example 
:  <br />SQL_ERROR = 07001 , 48  <br />The character string value returned 
for the ODBC error code consists of a two character class value followed by a 
three character subclass value. The assignment of class and subclass values is 
defined by ANSI SQL-92.  <br />The Native error code is an integer value 
which is specific to the Data Source.  Here follow the list of ODBC error 
codes :  </p>
