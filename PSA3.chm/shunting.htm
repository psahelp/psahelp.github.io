<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">When the Shunt button beside the 
work centre label is pressed all tasks in the in the visible window will be 
shunted up to the first task. If there are overlaps these will be shunted to the 
right and possibly out of the window. This process will continue until overlaps 
are removed and a gap appears in the schedule. There is no check during this 
process that relationships with preceding and following tasks are 
maintained.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">A ‘Backward Shunt’ facility has 
been provided to enable all tasks to be moved up to the rightmost visible task 
on the Planning Board. Moved tasks will be ‘shunted’ up to the rightmost task’s 
starting position. Moved tasks will automatically adjust to compensate for any 
‘Non-working periods’.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">The ‘Shunt Button Preferences’ 
button at the bottom of all the shunt buttons can be used to configure the 
default operation of the ‘shunt’ buttons.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri',sans-serif"><img src="ImagesExt/image9_92.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">In addition you can forward or 
backward shunt with out changing the preference from any shunt button by right 
clicking and selecting Forward Shunt or Backward Shunt from the context 
sensitive menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 92.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 92.7pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·    </span><a name="_Toc63472819" id="_Toc63472819"></a><a name="_Toc63438161" id="_Toc63438161"></a><a name="_Toc11722120" id="_Toc11722120"></a><a name="_Toc468632947" id="_Toc468632947"></a><a name="_Toc462045844" id="_Toc462045844">Insert Task Offset Facility</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The shunt buttons can also be configured to allow an ‘offset’ 
period to be inserted into the schedule for a given work centre. This is 
intended to be used to allow planners to compensate for any late running or 
delays encountered on the shop floor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The offset shunt allows entry of a start time, end time and 
offset. All tasks starting within the period have their start time moved back by 
the offset amount. Where this puts the start within a non working period the 
task will be scheduled to start after it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Where there are many small tasks and the offset is quite 
large this can result in several tasks being scheduled to start at the same time 
– after a non working period.<br />The behaviour has been changed and the rules 
are now<br />All tasks starting within the period will have their start time moved 
back by AT LEAST the offset amount<br />Any overlaps between tasks are resolved – 
this can increase the offset for the overlapping task.<br />The shunting process 
is continued after the end time specified until no overlaps are created</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 92.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 92.7pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·    </span>Shunt to 
current time</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By right clicking on a shunt button further options are 
available. They are particularly useful in bringing an out of date plan up to 
the current time.<br />The first option is ‘Shunt to current time’ which will 
bring all incomplete tasks from the past up to the current time in 
sequence.<br />This can be done for a single work centre, for all the work centres 
in the display code or for all work centres in the plan. Tasks in the current 
time frame are likely to be shunted to a later date and possibly become 
late.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 92.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 92.7pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·    </span>Gather 
Late tasks</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This works in a similar way to ‘Shunt to current time’. 
However no task is taken past the time line. They are all lined up to the left 
of the time line leaving a gap of an hour. Again this can be done for a single 
work centre, for all the work centres in the display code or for all work 
centres in the plan.</p></div></body></html>
