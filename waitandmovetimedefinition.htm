<p class="MsoNormal">The time that a task occupies on the planning board is made 
up of make ready time and run time. This can be extended (or reduced) if the 
work centre efficiency factor is less than 100% (or more). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When scheduling the task end time = task start time + ((task 
mr time + task run time) * 100 / work centre efficiency)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The end time will also be extended by the length of any non 
working periods that are relevant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The start time of the second task is calculated from values 
and parameters on the first task.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the first task has a style of ‘serial’ – the default – 
then the earliest start time of the second task is the end time of the first 
task plus any move time. Move time should be used for drying or curing time or, 
possibly, a quality check process. Move time can be entered in task maintenance 
but if a ‘default move time’ is set up for a work centre then PsaConnect will 
set the move time of tasks to the default for the work centre as the task is 
imported.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the first task has a style of ‘parallel’ then the earliest 
start time of the second task is the start time of the first task plus any wait 
time plus any move time. Wait time is defined as the length of time required to 
get sufficient output from the first task to be able to start the second task. 
Move time on the first task is normally zero but does not need to be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As tasks are imported by PsaConnect their style will be set 
to ‘parallel’ if the work centre default style is set to ‘parallel’. The field 
‘Minimum run time’ on the work centre is also used by PsaConnect to calculate a 
wait time. This is task make ready time plus the lesser of the work centre 
minimum run time and the actual task run time. This prevents the second task 
being scheduled long after the first task has finished because there is only a 
short run time on the first task.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In all cases, where a parallel style is in use, PSA will 
check that the end of the second task follows the end of the first task by at 
least the same time difference as the start of the tasks. This is known as an 
overtaking check and can occur when the second task runs faster than the first 
task, or has a smaller quantity, or has a greater work centre efficiency or has 
less non working time. If the second task is found to be ‘overtaking’ then the 
earliest end of the second task is calculated and the start time calculated 
backwards from the end.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If scheduling using contingency times then the first attempt 
at scheduling will use full contingency times and if this fails to meet the time 
constraints then the contingency is reduced and scheduling is repeated until 
contingency reaches zero if necessary. Wait time, move time and work centre 
efficiency are never varied to try to fit the schedule.</p>
