<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">The  button when toggled 
allows individual tasks to be split by quantity. On double clicking on the 
required task the task split form is loaded. You can also right click and select 
‘Split’ from the context sensitive menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">Splitting a task creates another 
task belonging to the same order and component as the original or parent task. 
It will normally have a task number that is one greater than the original 
task.<br />There are two possible screens that appear when ‘Task Split’ is 
selected. If there are no items or only one item then the simple split screen 
appears. If there is more than one item – or more accurately more than one print 
change then the alternative screen appears.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 92.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 92.7pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·    </span>Simple 
task split</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri',sans-serif"><img src="ImagesExt/image9_99.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">Information relating to the split 
task is shown in the top part of the screen; the new task that results from the 
split is defined in the lower part of the screen. The new task description, its 
designated work centre and delivery date can be set here, also the split 
quantity which determines the proportions of the split should be set, run time 
is automatically calculated depending on the selected speed.<br />If work centre 
speed is selected then the new task will run at the default speed of the 
selected work centre, otherwise the original task speed can be used.<br />By 
default, the new task will be created with the same Make Ready time as the 
original. This can be changed if required.<br />The ‘Shop Floor Feedback’ option 
will take into account any quantity completed from the original task as 
signalled from the SFDC system.<br />For finishing purposes you can also split the 
task into multiple parts – in the multiple split box enter the number of 
additional tasks required. Before entering a number here it may be convenient to 
enter the split quantity for each of these tasks and possibly the delivery date 
– it is assumed that multiple split like this apply to finishing tasks only. 
Also enter the appropriate make ready time. Now when you enter the number of 
splits an additional section is opened with brief detail of these new tasks. 
Particularly important is the delivery date as it is normal for these tasks to 
delivery dates greater than the order delivery date and be used to satisfy 
future call offs. Clicking in the appropriate cell and using the calendar button 
lets the real call off date be entered.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">Where there is more than one 
working sheet (print change) on a task a different screen appears.<br />This 
allows splitting in various ways.<br />The simplest is splitting into separate 
working sheets. This will result in as many tasks as there are working 
sheets.<br />If you select an item on one working sheet the option to separate 
that working sheet from all the others is opened. <br />On a finishing task all 
items are treated as one up on separate sheets – therefore it is possible to 
select a quantity – enter into the split quantity column – and proceed to 
split.<br />In the same mode you can select any quantity from each working sheet 
and split in quite a complex way.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">If finishing tasks have been split 
into separate print changes/items they can be recombined or the split details 
can be changed.<br />From the planning board again select split and the second 
screen will be opened. Then select the ‘Redistribute quantities between split 
tasks’ option. This will bring up details of both the current task and the one 
from which it has been split. By entering a new split quantity the distribution 
of items between the tasks may be changed. If all item quantities on one task go 
to zero the tasks will be recombined.<br />If a task has been split into more than 
two parts the ‘Next’ button will bring up successive pairs so that the 
quantities can be redistributed or combined.</p></div></body></html>
