<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri',sans-serif"><img src="ImagesExt/image9_54.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Work Centre Maintenance screen has all 
current work centres listed in grid top left. The grid sequence may be changed 
by clicking in the desired column of the title row.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Short and Long Descriptions</b> are available for clarity 
when selecting a work centre in various places within PSA3.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Suffix and KMS Number</b> – only required if the export to 
Komori or Heidelberg options are turned on. For a Komori you should select a 
numeric KMS number. For Heidelberg the suffix should be set to ‘H’</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Process Type and default sequence - </b>Each work centre 
should be assigned a process type and a default sequence; the default sequence 
should reflect the process sequence number if defined. The process sequence 
number for the selected process type will appear automatically when the process 
type is selected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Capability Group - </b>Work centres can be placed in a 
capability groups if required. The actual machine capability can then be refined 
by adding a number of conditions which must be satisfied before a task is 
allocated to this work centre. For example if the Technical Attribute GSM must 
have a value between 50 and 250 to be included in the refined capability group 
then set up two conditions ‘GSM &gt;= 50’ and ‘GSM &lt;= 250’. Similarly by 
selecting Colours &gt;= 4 a task with only 2 colours will not be scheduled onto 
this work centre. If the tested Technical Attribute has no value then it will 
pass the test. If both the Attribute and the test value are numeric then a 
numeric test is performed.<br />The special condition Technical Attribute (n) not 
like * should be used to ensure the condition is always failed. This will result 
in scheduling moving the task to another work centre in the same capability 
group.<br />To create a new ‘capability group’ simply type the new name into box 
on this screen – the separate tab for defining them has been removed as it is no 
longer required.<br />There are two other important uses. <br />Where estimating 
uses generic work centres tasks will transfer to PSA with the generic work 
centre. All tasks must be transferred from this work centre to a real work 
centres.<br />If estimating shows as separate work centres what is really a number 
of configurations of the same work centre then tasks will transfer with the 
configuration. These should be marked as generic and a capability group set up 
to enable PSA to transfer the task to the real work centre for correct 
scheduling.<br />Both of these are resolved by putting the real work centre and 
the generic or configuration variation into the same capability group.<br />This 
will cause scheduling to always switch tasks to another work centre</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Running speed, make ready and move time</b> - Defaults can 
be added here. They will be picked up if a new task is added but the main 
purpose is to determine the correct running speed of tasks as they are moved 
between work centreswhen the ratio of the default speeds and times are used. So 
if a task with estimated speed 8234 is moved from a work centre with default 
speed 8500 to a work centre with speed 9500 they the task speed will be set to 
8234 * 9500 / 8500 = 9203. Moving it back would restore the estimated 8234.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Efficiency Factor - </b>Where a work centre normally 
achieves 85% productive time, and this is reflected in the costs, then 
scheduling tasks without gaps would result in creep where the actual shop floor 
performance falls behind the schedule. A work centre efficiency factor has been 
added to allow more accurate scheduling in this situation.<br />The default is 
100% so not entering a value will leave scheduling unchanged. On work centres 
where the factor is set the plot of the task on the planning board is stretched 
by 100/factor to allow for unscheduled stoppages. The reported speed and run 
times are not changed so details entered in estimating still pass through to 
SFDC.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overs Warning - </b>A warning message has been introduced 
to the Manual Task Update routine. If the quantity entered as complete exceeds 
the task quantity plus an allowed percentage of overs a warning is 
displayed.<br />The percentage that triggers this warning and whether it is in use 
is set here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Packing Material</b> - As Packing material is not 
allocated to a specific task setting this flag allows PsaConnect to attach 
packing materials to the first task on a work centre with this flag set rather 
than using the first task on the component which is the default.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Infinite Schedule</b> - The Infinite Schedule flag should 
be used for work centres that have Outwork type processes. Tasks scheduled on 
this work centre will be scheduled to follow the previous task and may overlap 
other tasks on the same work centre.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Freeze Active/Freeze Moving/Isolate Firm Zone – </b>these 
define ways of separating the area after the time line on any work centre into 
firm and free zones. With just Freeze active turned on a dragable firm line is 
added to the planning board display and Dynamic Work To List. Tasks within the 
firm area are passed to SFDC – those outside are retained in PSA or withdrawn 
from SFDC if previously transferred. The line remains at the last point it is 
dragged to and will eventually be ‘overtaken’ by the time line if not moved 
regularly. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Turning on ‘Freeze Moving’ has the effect that the firm line 
will stay the same distance in front of the time line. This prevents it being 
overtaken but has the effect that tasks outside the firm zone will fall inside 
the firm zone, and so be passed to SFDC, without any action being taken.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To overcome these limitations we have ‘Isolate Firm Zone’ 
where a number of hours: minutes to define the zone should be entered. The size 
should be the approximate number of hours work you want to maintain as available 
for starting in SFDC. Tasks will always be scheduled outside this firm zone. 
They can only get inside the firm zone if dragged on the planning board or moved 
on the Dynamic Work To List. You can also adjust the size of the firm zone on 
the Dynamic Work To List. The flag on the planning board will always be the 
defined number of available hours, ignoring non working periods, ahead of the 
time line. If you overload the firm zone by putting say 100 estimated hours into 
an 80 hour zone this will push the flag back further to keep a clear distinction 
between tasks inside and tasks outside the zone. There are no borderline cases – 
every task is fully in or fully out of the zone.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>New Name</b> – changing a work centre name with tasks, non 
working periods, maintenance and display codes linked to it. This allows these 
processes to be carried out when necessary. Set the new name here, apply and a 
‘Name Change’ button will appear. This will apply the changes followed by a full 
assessment check so it is best to set up all the name changes required before 
pressing the ‘Name Change’ button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ignore if prior</b> – check this box if tasks on this work 
centre should be ignored when displaying ‘prior task status’. The main use for 
this is when additional tasks, essentially for costing purposes, have been added 
between real tasks on real work centres</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Custom WorkList</b> - Names a custom report to be used 
rather than worklist.rpt when a work to list is requested for this work 
centre.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif">XFer 
To SFDC</span></b><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif"> – there 
are 4 options here – <br />     <b>‘Never ‘</b> - if the tasks 
are not going to be processed in SFDC there is no point in sending 
them<br /><b>     ‘Before scheduled’</b> – this is the exact 
opposite – tasks will transfer to SFDC as soon as they appear in PSA – even 
before they are scheduled – not often used<br /><b>     ‘When 
scheduled’</b> – as described – when it is scheduled it will transfer to SFDC – 
this probably means that tasks without resources or not in the correct sequence 
will transfer<br /><b>     ‘When in Firm Zone’</b> – if using 
the Firm Zone (Freeze Line) tasks will only transfer to SFDC when within the 
zone – this allows SFDC to only see tasks that have been placed there, have 
resources available and have been sequenced for most efficient production – 
recommended</span><b> </b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Global Filter Codes </b>– these can be ignored at this 
time – reserved for future use<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Generic – </b>check this box if the work centre is 
genuinely generic – that is used only for estimating purposes. PSA3 will always 
attempt, using capability groups to move a work centre from a generic to a real 
work centre. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Generic work centres cannot be selected in a display code or 
viewed on the planning board. If you wish to display ‘dummy’ work centres as a 
style of scheduling see ‘First schedule to’ below.<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cost Rate – </b>when transferring a task from a generic to 
a real work centre using capability groups rather than using a schedule date as 
the criterion PSA3 will use the lowest cost rate – this allows some discretion 
in which work centre task moved from generic are moved to.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>No Tentative – </b>currently has no function and may be 
ignored<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Auto Complete – </b>Any task on this work centre will be 
marked complete in PSA when a following task is also marked complete. The 
checking process is iterative so marking all the work centres exception 
finishing processes as auto complete and finishing the last task will complete 
all the tasks of the order.<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Completion Report -</b> Names a custom report to be used 
when a task on this work centre is completed.<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>% MR Reduction – </b>when setting a task as follow-on the 
make ready time of the follow on task will be reduced by this percentage. The 
original version, and default, is 100% but perhaps 70% or 80% is more 
realistic<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bypass PSA – </b>allows tasks on this work centre to 
bypass PSA altogether. PsaConnect will pass them directly to SFDC where they 
will appear on the WorkList unscheduled but available. They cannot be scheduled 
as they are never visible in PSA<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Default MR Assistants – </b>a recent addition to the 
planning board makes total MR and Run assistants visible on the planning board. 
If they have not been specifically estimated then a default value may be entered 
here</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Default Run Assistants – </b>a recent addition to the 
planning board makes total MR and Run assistants visible on the planning board. 
If they have not been specifically estimated then a default value may be entered 
here<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Counter Digits – </b>When working with SFDC Lite on work 
centres that have ‘life time’ counters allows the number of digits to be 
specified – this allows the user to enter actual counter value rather than good 
copies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Count - </b>When working with SFDC Lite on work centres 
that have ‘life time’ counters allows the current counter value to be specified 
– this allows the user to enter actual counter value rather than good 
copies.<b></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Display number wide –</b> for business forms only – 
replaces number up with number wide</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>First Schedule To –</b> this represents an alternative 
method of dividing up the planning board. Instead of separating each work centre 
into firm and free zones – with the firm tasks going to SFDC – we take each 
department and add a ‘dummy’ work centre that will appear on the plan and is 
usually infinitely scheduled. All the other work centres in the department will 
‘First Schedule To’ this work centre so that it acts as a store for unscheduled 
task in the department. By ensuring that the ‘First Schedule To’ is a backward 
schedule the tasks are as late as possible (allowing for contingency) as they 
can be. The scheduler can then drag them to a work centre of his/her choice. 
When dragging the original estimated work centre will always be highlighted in 
green to clarify the process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Delete Button</b> The Delete work centre button now allows 
the work centre and all associated tasks, items, materials and non working 
periods to be deleted. On completion of the delete a full Assessment Check is 
run to relink remaining tasks and components.</p></div></body></html>
