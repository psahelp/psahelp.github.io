<p class="MsoNormal">The schedule style and options area have been moved here – 
move the mouse over the green bar on the right and these options appear – move 
the mouse back over the grid and the options are again hidden</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The filter area is normally hidden – move the mouse over the 
green bar on the left and the filter area appears – it remains visible until the 
filter button is pressed leaving a cleaner screen</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 92.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 92.7pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·    </span>Schedule 
Style</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This area selects backward or forward scheduling as before 
but adds ‘Work Centre Prioritised’<br />In this style, if the orders have been 
filtered for those with tasks using a work centre or group of work centres, then 
the scheduling process will start with the first task on the filtered work 
centre and then follow a ‘fixed point schedule’ procedure to schedule the other 
tasks. This should ensure that if a group of orders have been sequenced for 
optimum press usage then, when they are scheduled as a group, the tasks will be 
laid down on the press in exactly the chosen sequence and prepress tasks fitted 
in as required rather than the press sequence being determined by the prepress 
schedule.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 92.7pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 92.7pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·    </span>Schedule 
options</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This area is carried forward from earlier versions of PSA – 
only the interface has been made considerably more flexible and informative.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Infinite Scheduling</b> - Treats each work centre as 
having infinite capacity. Useful for quickly getting all tasks onto the planning 
board and outwork processes</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Include Firmed Orders</b> – only to be used for a full 
reschedule – Firmed orders are treated as free and will be rescheduled</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Include Firmed/Started tasks</b> – again only to be used 
in limited circumstances – will reschedule individual firmed tasks and started 
tasks – if SFDC is in use started tasks will quickly return to the time line as 
they are aligned with SFDC actuals</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Resource Constrained Scheduling</b> – applies only to 
forward scheduling – it is assumed when backward scheduling that all resources 
will be available. This option will schedule tasks in the future depending on 
the reported availability of all critical materials and resources. Where no date 
is known for all resources to be available the task will be scheduled at least n 
days (defined under Configuration/System/Resources) in advance. If a task is 
scheduled later than the earliest possible date it will be marked as Constrained 
and will appear Red under the CN neon.<br />Using this flag decides whether the 
schedule drives the resource requirements (unchecked) or resource availability 
drives the scheduled dates (checked)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Capability Group Scheduling</b> – When scheduling tasks 
may be moved to alternative work centres having similar capability to achieve 
load balancing among work centres. The actual rules to determine which work 
centre is capable are defined under Work Centre Maintenance. With this option 
not checked tasks will always remain on the estimated work centre. This is also 
true if no work centre, including the estimated one, is found to satisfy the 
capability rules. When capability group scheduling the selected work centre will 
be that which can complete the task earliest when forward scheduling or start 
the task latest when backward scheduling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Forward Schedule Late Orders</b> – if when backward 
scheduling the result gives the first task starting earlier than now then the 
order will be forward scheduled and must end up with the last task finishing 
late.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Keep Multi-passes together</b> – where there are 
consecutive tasks of an order on the same work centre (most common with Radius I 
systems using ‘work and turn’) then this will force these tasks to be scheduled 
as one. Note that it only applies to tasks on the same component. If the tasks 
on the same work centre are on different components then this flag will not keep 
them together – consider the next option</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Schedule all tasks as one component</b> – An alternative 
to the standard method of scheduling that schedules on a component by component 
basis. This option takes all the tasks and sorts them by process type and 
sequence. This is useful with Radius I systems where separate working sheets can 
appear on separate components. This will now make the ‘Keep Multi-passes 
Together’ option treat all the tasks for one work centre as a single large 
task</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Use Task Delivery Dates</b> – normally checked – only task 
delivery dates after the order delivery date have any function and they normally 
represent a delivery schedule where gluing tasks are required prior to shipment. 
In this case such tasks will be backward scheduled prior to the task delivery 
date rather than forward scheduled after cutting. If no such forward task 
delivery dates exist then the flag has no effect.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Do not schedule in Firm area</b> – normally checked – 
where dynamic firm lines are in use will keep scheduled tasks out of the firm 
area. If the isolated Firm Zone is in use then tasks are never scheduled in the 
firm area regardless of this flag setting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As for the Unplanned tab the columns displayed on the Planned 
tab may be chosen and sequenced on the Preferences tab. There are two additional 
columns – Before and After that show roughly where the order is currently 
scheduled in relation to the delivery or promised date. If not scheduled the 
column will show white. After a schedule process the After column will show 
roughly whether the date has improved or worsened. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Multiple filters are also available as for the Unplanned 
tab</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By right clicking on an order you get a context sensitive 
menu allowing the display to expanded for multiple attributes or compressed to a 
single line, to print the entire Planned tab grid, to jump to Order Maintenance 
for this order or to Task Maintenance for a specific task, to Schedule the 
order, to Unplan it or to select all the rows prior to sort function.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If more than one row is selected right clicking on the 
selection you get a context sensitive menu allowing the group to be scheduled, 
the group to be sorted ascending or descending by the column in which the right 
click occurred, a multicolumn sort to be run – this allows up to 10 columns to 
be selected for the sort (ascending or descending – numeric sort for numeric 
columns – date sort for columns with valid dates), again print the Planned grid 
or Group the selected orders – see ‘Group Orders’ below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Buttons are available lower left to move an order up or down 
in the sequence. This only makes sense if the order and all the orders it has 
been moved past are rescheduled. This is because the schedule process takes the 
tasks off the board but when rescheduling is likely only to have the same slots 
to schedule it in. By rescheduling the whole sequence of orders all the tasks 
are taken off the plan and can then be scheduled in the new sequence – starting 
with the top of the list. This gives a chance for the tasks to be laid down in 
the new sequence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Buttons are available below the grid to start a Full schedule 
of all orders – a warning is given – to stop a full schedule, to search for a 
specific order in the list.</p></div></body></html>
